# eFuse Voltmeter in fault

## Project Description
eFuse_Voltmeter is a protection circuit for down stream electronic devices. The initial reason for the device was to protect a Ham radio when adjusting bias of RF mosfets. The fets can hit thermal run-way and destroy traces and themselves.

It can be powered from any DC power source between 5 to 25 volts. Its been test up to 6 amps.  At 5 amps the two inline mostfets drop 150millvolts each and the sense resistor drops 81 millvolts. Except for the mosfets it should work at much higher currents. So two the mosfets should be upgraded. 

Features:
1. Reverse power protection.
2. Adjustable input over voltage input protection
3. Adjustable over current protection.
4. Voltage and current monitoring.
5. Output power control.
6. Output power disconnected on fault.
7. Audio alarm on fault.

When an over voltage or an over current event happens the board will disable its output. The fault state is latched until the control buttons is pressed. Apond a fault an audio alarm is also actived and a fault LEDs is lite. The fault value is indicted by its red measurement value and the fault RED led is lite. A fault is cleared by pressing the adjusement button. The output button needs to be press again to reable the boards output.
 
### Project Status
The project is basically complete. Working on improvements.
